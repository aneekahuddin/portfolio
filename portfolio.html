  <h2>What Have I Made? (A.K.A. Bragging Rights)</h2>

  <h3> My First Game <h3>
  <img src="sidescroller.png.png" alt="Side Scroller" width="240" height="180" > </img>
  <p> Introducing Jump! The new radical game that is extremely addictive and everyone who is anyone on Scratch is playing this. 
  The game has simple instruction. Press Play to begin. Be ready for the tall blocks. They are scrolling to the left. 
  Use the space bar to jump over the blocks. Land on the blue pads to score points. If you're feeling extra ambitious try 
  grabbing the coins to boost your score. You cannot touch the blocks and you have three lives which means you can touch the blocks 
  three times. The maximum points you can receive are 200. I am proud that the game actually worked! Are you up for a challenge?</p> 
  <p>In reality, Jump isn't that radically addictive and is a simple side scroller game that my fellow GWC peer, Daniela Abril, and I 
  made. It features moving sprites and sensing with color to create and enhance the game.</p>

  <h3> Text Adventure </h3>
  <img src="textadventuresnippet.png" alt="Text Adventure" width="638" height="84"></img>
  <p> Text Adventure was a GWC project that was based off of Choose Your Own Adventure. We had to code a program in Python that
  presented us with a story line and you could pick what decision you wanted. So above is a snippet from our story map. You press 1 or 2
  to continue the story. Any other key would create an error and reprompt the question. Once you hit the end of the game you could 
  press 3 to restart. </p>
  <p> This was a nice way to be introduced to functions. It got rid of the over repetitiveness and cleaned up the code a lot.</p>
